# multipath_scheduling

test_schedulers.py compares different schedulers for offline multi-path traces that are captured  by concurrent wifi-lte transmissions. Currently contains round robin, edpf and pmf based schedulers.

multiarmed bandit algorithms are adopted from: https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/BanditsBook, to be used in test_schedulers.py
